First of all, I designed and programmed several advanced puzzle levels. For example, I built a level\n               that requires the players to write a program with a while loop, to teach about the relationship between indefinite iterations and \n               conditional statements. The player must write and modify their program so that a fire-breathing statue will pause at a specific \n               specific location, lighting up a torch for the player to progress through the game. LEVEL_5_1I’ve also worked on the syntax \n               highlighting for the player’s coding interface, making the compiler recognize specific inputs and color coding them, just like how\n                any IDEs utilize syntax highlighting. This was done by splitting the player input into keys such as brackets or boolean expressions\n                 while temporarily storing the inputted data for inputs that are longer than one character (not separated by any whitespace). \n                 Alongside, I have been a big part of creating the village for May’s Journey. Ive designed and built the interior of various village\n                  buildings, while also designing and animating the NPCs using Maximo. Additionally, I have utilized Markov Chain with the game’s \n                  playtest data to predict the most common errors made by the players while programming. This data was collected for both research \n                  on educational games and creating a help tool for the players to utilize when they were stuck on a puzzle. Utilizing pickle, \n                  numpy, and the scikit-learn library, I split the data into predicting and testing data frames for a valid prediction. \n            </h3>\n            <h3 className=\"lastParagraph\">Not only did I learn numerous skills regarding game development, I also learned how to work with a team. Communicating mostly \n              through Slack offline and having weekly meetings, our team was able to stay on top of what everyone was working on. Our team utilized\n               GitHub as our source control for Unity, allowing us to maintain our large amount of files and data in a structured format. </h3>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MaysJourneyGame;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport \"./GameInfo.css\"\n\nclass DefenseHorizonGame extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"gameContext\">\n      <div className=\"gameInfoWrapper\">\n       <div className=\"gameTitle\">Defense Horizon</div>\n       <h2>What is Defense Horizon?</h2>\n       <h3>\tDefense Horizon is an FPS game with the twist of a tower defense game mechanic.

The game development progress was split into 4 iterations. The prototype, alpha release, beta release, and the gold\n          master release. </h3>\n       <h2>What I did</h2>\n       <h3>\tI was in charge of creating and programming the wall functionality, enemy AI, shoot mechanic, player movements, and the slowdown\n          weapon functionality. The enemy AI is implemented with a Finite-State Machine (FSM) where each state is attached to an animation \n          for the enemy model. I utilized the navigation mesh (NavMesh) in Unity for the enemies to activate pathfinding towards the tower \n          while avoiding obstacles. The wall functionality was implemented with the usage of MeshRenderers and triggers. Using these allowed\n           one wall to be highlighted, which indicated the fact that the user may select the highlighted wall. The triggers acted to determine\n            contact with the enemies, and allowed users to upgrade the walls for more health. I was able to program the shooting and moving \n            mechanic with vector mathematics with proper force behaviors. </h3>\n       <h2>Challenges / Improvements</h2>\n       <h3>One of the balancing issues we came across was the difficulty of the game. Playtesters deemed it was very difficult to beat the game \n         as the enemies seemed to be spawning too quickly. However, even after fixing the spawn rates, the players seemed to be having trouble \n         due to the enemies attacking different parts of the tower. This made it hard for the players to protect all locations of the tower since \n         when the player was defeating the enemies in time in one position of the tower, the other side of the tower was being damaged. To overcome\n          this issue, a shop mechanic was implemented so that the players may upgrade their weapons, purchase new weapons, and strengthen the walls\n           by increasing their health with gold they collect by defeating enemies. This new mechanic added variety in the player’s tactics, and \n           gave support to be able to defeat the enemies more quicker. We included unique items such as a slow bomb, which splatters pallets that \n           slows enemies when they are walking through them, and the poison arrow which damages the enemies for 5% of their health every second,\n            until the enemy dies. </h3>\n       <h3 className=\"lastParagraph\">In the future, I would like to develop Defense Horizon into a VR game. Defense Horizon VR will have new mechanics that will let the \n         player immerse themselves into the game world even further. From being able to see the Northern Tower in real life size, having real 360\n          degrees spatial and sound awareness that can be used to identify enemy location, and aiming with your hand motions. I envision Defense \n          Horizon VR to look something like the game <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8XPi1ioLlc\" \n          style={{textDecoration: 'none', color: \"#222626\"}}>Castle Must Be Mine</a>, a VR tower defense game where the player views the world\n           in a third person perspective.

I was the only other programmer, so communication and teamwork was key to create \n              a game in such a fast paced environment. Our team had constant and effective communication since we were working on call for most of our time.\n               This allowed for a quick back and forth communication on questions, clarifications, and suggestions. For example, I was constantly communicating\n                with the arts team to make sure the sizes/pixels were right for the sprites. Our team also used Notion to organize our workflow by labelling \n                tasks as ‘next up’, ‘in progress’, ‘can improve later’, and ‘completed’. We also used Notion to organize our brainstorming ideas and add notes of\n                 encouragement to teammates to boost team morale, which was very successful. The encouragements showed appreciation towards each other and\n                  celebrated accomplishments throughout the jam. Additionally, we wrote a draft for our game design document on Notion. </h3>\n            <h3>For this game jam, we utilized Unity to build the game and GitHub for source control. I worked on player movement, collectable behavior (Cookies/Stars),\n               enemy behavior (including movements and position placements for when they swap back to collectables), GameState (progression through levels,\n                win/lost state), MainMenu functionality, Pause menu functionality and general bug fixes. Working on these was a fun challenge as every time I was able\n                 to complete one component, I was excited to share with the team on what our game is capable of. Similarly, I was eccentric to see the art team’s \n                 updates, which motivated me to complete programming Narcoleptic Nummies in such a time restricted environment. </h3>\n            <h2>Challenges / Improvements</h2>\n            <h3>There were many challenges that arose during development. First of all, I felt like Narcoleptic Nummies didn’t reach their potential due to the restricted \n              time. Although this game was created during a game jam and the time restriction is just a part of the challenge, I felt like the game could have been \n              made more ‘fun’ if we had more time to iterate on the game. By the time we were ready for playtesting the completed and polished levels, we didn’t have\n               enough times to make all the changes we wanted to, such as giving better cues to the players to help progress through the game. Players found it difficult \n               to play at times since the sudden changes of platform made them fall off stage. I was trying to implement a mechanic where the incoming changes to the \n               platform will be shown in a less opacity a second before the change, but I did not have enough time to execute this mechanic. Therefore, in a future game\n                jam, I would like to start brainstorming before the game jam begins, even if the game jam is supposed to have a theme. I feel like our team spent a bit too\n                 much time on brainstorming, which resulted in us rushing at the end of development. I believe our team can think of a general game idea beforehand, and\n                  apply the game jam’s theme into our game. I would like to get a brief idea of a game and even possibly make a prototype to see if the idea is ‘fun’. </h3>\n            <h3>I spent a lot of time debugging, which caused me to have an even shorter time for development. There were some big issues with the player colliders, where \n              the player would get stuck on a wall, not be able to jump at times, etc. In the future, I would like to use a CharacterController to avoid some extra codes \n              and procedures to apply the isGrounded field, which determines if the player is landed on a ground. I can also fix collision issues by using the colliders for\n               collision, instead of triggers. </h3>\n            <h3 className=\"lastParagraph\">Additionally, I would want to think of more unique ideas that make the game more fun and interesting. The game was pretty basic,\n             with simple gameplay of collecting materials by moving and jumping around platforms. A possible way to make the game more interesting is by adding unique \n             player movement mechanics, which can allow players to get creative on maneuvering around the stage and avoid sudden appearances of monsters and/or beets, which \n             are considered the enemies of the game. </h3>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default NarcolepticNummiesGame;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport \"./GameInfo.css\"\n\nclass ScoopsGame extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n          <div className=\"gameContext\">\n           <div className=\"gameInfoWrapper\">\n            <div className=\"gameTitle\">Scoops</div>\n            <h2>What is Scoops?</h2>\n            <h3>Scoops is a 2D puzzle bubble shooter game word game with an ice cream theme.

Since Scoops is a bubble popping game, I also had to implement the wall bounce mechanic.\n                This was done through programming the reflecting vector and applying a force to the scoop (bullet) to change trajectory.\n                 I also programmed an algorithm where it will calculate and add the points based on the word submitted.

The task of forming \n            words by aiming and selecting which letters to choose was interesting as it is tied with the player’s knowledge of existing words, \n            but the gameplay soon got stale. We believe this is because of the repetitive gameplay without any twist that makes the gameplay \n            unique and fun every time the game is played. We decided to implement ice cream orders, where the word that must be created with \n            the bubbles is given to the player. The orders are words that can be formed with the shootable bubbles and the player must form \n            these words by shooting the necessary bubbles. The orders are very similar to the ones in Overcooked!, where the player must cook \n            the dishes that are given as orders. We decided to make this another game mode, since the difficulty level drops as players are not \n            required to utilize their knowledge of words. This game mode is aimed more towards young players, who may still be in the developing \n            stage, to learn more words. The original mode is aimed towards players who want to challenge themselves by wanting to achieve the\n             highest score. Another challenge we faced is that we ended up having to iterate our game several times during development. We \n             realized this was due to lack of iteration and prototype playtesting. In the future, we will have a clearer goal, with a physical \n             playable prototype to determine if the game idea is well suited for a fun game. </h3>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ScoopsGame;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport \"./GameInfo.css\"\n\nclass HostageEscapeRoomGame extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n          <div className=\"gameContext\">\n           <div className=\"gameInfoWrapper\">\n            <div className=\"gameTitle\">Hostage Escape Room</div>\n            <h2>What is Hostage Escape Room?</h2>\n            <h3>Hostage Escape Room is a 3D first person hostage-themed escape room game where the player must solve puzzles to escape \n              a room that they have no memory of being in.

Additionally, I implemented the key mechanic where the player \n               can escape from a room when holding a key.

I was able to design and plan the website structure with Figma, \n              a collaborative design tool. Our team decided to transition from Vue to React, since we wanted to utilize tools that are being used more often in \n              the industry, and to further define our React skills. Additionally, we used Typescript for a simplified JavaScript code, and a good compatibility \n              with Material UI. This was important especially because our goal was to complete this website within 2 weeks, so that people can use our website to \n              apply and be a part of C4C. Almost all of our design was created with Material-UI due to the flexibility of Material UI Cards. My main work was related \n              to the People page. It was important to be able to add and delete members easily and quickly since we were planning to add our new coming members to\n               the page. I was able to structure the People page sotthat members can be added and deleted very easily with a “Member” component I created, which \n               requires only a member’s full name, position, email, linkedin, and image. I made the board page design based on polaroids, where each person represents\n                a polaroid card. This was created with a high elevation of the card components for each member. The polaroid idea was not planned, but came naturally\n                 while messing around with Material-UI. The polaroid design gained positive feedback, so I ended up going through with the design. Additionally, I \n                 created a css hover effect that animates a fade in for the email and linkedin information for each member. Other than the People page, I assisted \n                 with the navbar and the general layout of other pages such as the Home and Jumpstart page. </h3>\n            <h2>Challenges / Improvements</h2>\n            <h3 className=\"lastParagraph\">The main challenge I faced during development was the fact that I didn’t know how to do most of the things I was implementing. I didn’t know \n                anything about Vue and front end development, so I spent a lot of time researching and asking questions to other members. It took me a lot of \n                time to get to a state where I understood what was going on. Similarly, I didn’t know anything about databases at that time. I also had to \n                research and ask many questions to understand what was going on. Fortunately, C4C is full of talented students who are willing to help others\n                 learn. I was able to gain support from the members to grow as a programmer and apply my learnings to this project. I hope to be able to help \n                 other programmers who are in need of help using the knowledge and skills I attained. </h3>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default C4CWebsite;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport \"./ProjectInfo.css\"\n\nclass LinGO extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n          <div className=\"projectContext\">\n           <div className=\"projectInfoWrapper\">\n            <div className=\"projectTitle\">LinGO</div>\n            <h2>What is LinGO?</h2>\n            <h3>LinGO is an on-demand translator service, connecting live translators with people who require translations in high \n                stake environments such as the doctor’s appointment.

As one of the event sponsors was Wix, they wanted us to use Wix Code as our \n                development platform. So, we decided to take on this challenge and create our software and website using Wix. First of all, the\n                 developers and the designers had very different reactions to the platform. The designers found it to be so much easier than coding \n                 a page from scratch. Their drag and drop interface works extremely well and it's very easy to get things to work the way you want. \n                 On the other hand, the developers were continually frustrated with the limitations that Wix Code had. I was mainly part of the design\n                  team, but also participated in the development of LinGO. We had restrictions on libraries and packages that we could use, we found \n                  the database to be overly difficult to utilize, the user system was also confusing and some of the user libraries seemed to outright\n                   not work (Wix Code was still in Beta at this point). Thus we had to build the user and session token system from scratch. </h3>\n            <h3>Being mainly in the design team, I had a fun time designing the website. Like mentioned before, the easy UI/UX structure of Wix made \n                it easy to implement unique designs to the website. However, the development side was a little more challenging. Instead of jumping \n                into development, we had to do a lot of research first about how the platform worked and dive into it's documentation. After that, we \n                found a huge limitation to be the lack of ability to work on the same project altogether. We spent a good deal of time trying to figure\n                out the best way to do user authentication with Wix Code because there was a built in user engine but we didn't like everything it \n                provided and also felt it was missing some functionality. </h3>\n            <h3>Wix Code had restrictions on libraries and packages that we could use, we found the database to be overly difficult to utilize, the \n                user system was also confusing and some of the user libraries seemed to outright not work as Wix Code was still in Beta during this\n                 time. Thus we had to build the user and session token system from scratch. </h3>\n            <h3>Working with Wix forced our team to think outside the box and lower our reliability on packages and libraries. We implemented an in-browser \n                peer to peer calling system using WebRTC. This was really interesting to build but again constantly ran into roadblocks with Wix Code.\n                 Firstly, we needed to have custom HTML added to our page. Wix Code doesn't allow any interactions with their generated HTML. Instead,\n                  we had to embed this code into an IFrame that can't interact with any outside code, which initially should've been fine. However, Chrome \n                  now does not allow IFrames to be given access to things like the microphone or audio without that permission being given in the IFrame.\n                   Sadly, Wix Code didn't allow usme to interact with the IFrame. To get around this, we needed to add some JavaScript to the main page that \n                   would add the properties to the IFrame on load. Wix Code doesn't provide any of that kind of functionality. Instead, we found that behind\n                    a paid subscription, we could get it to run custom code on the HTML (originally for data collection purposes). With this our team was \n                    able to write a quick script that would add the permission parameters to the IFrame whenever it was added to the DOM.</h3>\n            <h2>Challenges / Improvements</h2>\n            <h3 className=\"lastParagraph\">Our design-work looked really nice, but we let it pull too much focus from our project. Our user authentication \n            service was both a time drain, and unnecessary. We should've prototyped the important features of our app first, and had the extra information\n             put somewhere else. Our app first and foremost should've connected users searching for a translator to find someone who could translate for \n             them. This is what's important for a presentation. The extra information would be helpful for potential users, but that shouldn't have been \n             something we were worried about in this first build. The user system was also unnecessary bulk because it just distracted from what our true \n             purpose is supposed to be, though it was pretty cool to work on. Lessons I will take with me going forward.</h3>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default LinGO;","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport \"./ProjectInfo.css\"\n\nclass PerosnalWebsite extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n          <div className=\"projectContext\">\n           <div className=\"projectInfoWrapper\">\n            <div className=\"projectTitle\">Personal Portfolio Website</div>\n            <h2>What is my Personal Portfolio Website?</h2>\n            <h3> This website is my personal portfolio website that showcases my past projects and games, created from scratch with React. \n              It is a scroll-based one page website that helps users better understand who I am, and my achievements. </h3>\n            <h2><a href=\"https://github.com/kiminlee2000225/kiminlee2000225.github.io/tree/react-main\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" className=\"projectLink\">GitHub</a></h2>\n            <h2>Tools used</h2>\n            <h3>React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, GitHub</h3>\n            <h2>What I did</h2>\n            <h3>I decided to make my portfolio website scroll based for a few reasons. First of all, I wanted to minimize render time caused by jumping from one page \n            to another on a website. As a scroll based website, all components will be rendered in the beginning, then the user is free to view every aspect of the page \n            without having to wait for render time. Another reason I chose my website to be scroll-based is for the modern aesthetic, and the possibility of adding parallax \n            images. Currently, I don’t have any parallax images, but I may add parallax images that fit to the background, which will allow a smoother scrolling interaction \n            feel to the users. </h3>\n            <h3>I started off by creating the main pages including Home, About, Projects, Games, Resume, and Contacts. I initially wanted to embed my resume as a pdf file onto \n            my website, but I decided to make it an external link due to the aesthetic challenges of my resume file being black and white. I then added text for each page such\n             as the header to get the basic structure of the webpage. For the Projects and Games page, I implemented a grid tile system to display each project/game as its own \n             clickable element as a pop up. I utilized an overlay component for the pop-up effect, so that users can learn more about my projects/games including what I did,\n              what tools I used, and challenges.</h3>\n            <h3>For the finishing touches, I experimented with various designs with css. I experimented with various colors such as white/orange and black/pink, but ended up \n            choosing the black/light brown color scheme for its soft and casual feel. I finished up developing the webpage with applying css media queries for various mobile sizes. \n            I was able to purchase the domain “kiminlee.com” and host my website through GitHub.</h3>\n            <h3>I really enjoyed creating my website because of the flexibility I had from creating this project from scratch by myself.

Usually navbars lay on the top of the webpage, but I\n             wanted my navbar to be very interactive, where it will appear when the user scrolls down, and disappear when the user scrolls up. For this, I utilized react hooks to \n             set different states of the scroll and determine if the user has scrolled up or not. With this, I was able to make a css class that changed its class name when the\n              navbar is hidden or visible. Additionally, I programmed a throttle mechanism for the website to assist in determining the scrolls.</h3>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default PerosnalWebsite;","import React from 'react';\nimport \"./Projects.css\"\nimport { Overlay } from '@blueprintjs/core'; \nimport { PoseGroup } from 'react-pose';\nimport { CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group';\nimport Bento from \"./myprojects/Bento.js\";\nimport SFFTB from \"./myprojects/SFFTB.js\";\nimport LLB from \"./myprojects/LLB.js\";\nimport C4CWebsite from \"./myprojects/C4CWebsite.js\";\nimport LinGO from \"./myprojects/LinGO.js\";\nimport PersonalWebsite from \"./myprojects/PersonalWebsite.js\";\nimport ScrollAnimation from 'react-animate-on-scroll';\n\nlet rowSize = 3;\nvar mq = window.matchMedia(`(max-width: 812px)`);\nif(mq.matches) {\n  rowSize = 2;\n} else {\n  rowSize = 3;\n}\n\nconst projects = [{image: '/assets/images/bento2.png', title: \"Bento\", description: \"Recipe Builder Software\", component: <Bento/>},\n                  {image: '/assets/images/sfft.png', title: \"Speak for the Trees Boston\", description: \"Tree Block Reservation System\", component: <SFFTB/>},\n                  {image: '/assets/images/llb.png', title: \"Lucy's Love Bus\", description: \"Event Management System\", component: <LLB/>},\n                  {image: '/assets/images/c4c.png', title: \"Code 4 Community Website\", description: \"Northeastern University Club Website\", component: <C4CWebsite/>},\n                  {image: '/assets/images/lingo.png', title: \"LinGO\", description: \"Live Translator Service\", component: <LinGO/>},\n                  {image: '/assets/images/website.png', title: \"Personal Portfolio Website\", description: \"This website!\", component: <PersonalWebsite/>}];\n\nfunction Projects() {\n  const [drawer, setDrawer] = React.useState(null);\n  return (\n      <div className=\"projects\" id=\"projects\">\n        <div className=\"projectsComponents\">\n          <div className=\"titleAlignProjects\">\n            <div className=\"projectsCenter\">\n              <div className=\"projectsWrapper\">\n                <div className=\"projectsText\">\n                <ScrollAnimation animateIn=\"fadeInDown\" animateOnce={true} delay={1}>\n                  <div className=\"titleProjects\"><span>Projects</span></div>\n                  </ScrollAnimation>\n                  <ScrollAnimation animateIn=\"fadeInLeft\" animateOnce={true} delay={300} duration={1} offset={450}>\n                    <ProjectsGrid projects={projects} setDrawer={setDrawer}/>\n                  </ScrollAnimation>\n                </div>\n                  <CSSTransition in={!!drawer} timeout={500} classNames=\"popup\" unmountOnExit>\n                  <Overlay className=\"overlayComponent\" hasBackdrop={false} canOutsideClickClose={true} \n                            usePortal={false} isOpen={!!drawer} onClose={() => setDrawer(null)}>\n                    <button className=\"exitButton\" onClick={() => setDrawer(null)}>x</button>\n                    {drawer ?
