We decided to implement ice cream orders, where the word that must be created with the bubbles is given to the player.

However, Chrome now does not allow IFrames to be given access to things like the microphone or audio without that permission being given in the IFrame. Sadly, Wix Code didn't allow usme to interact with the IFrame. To get around this, we needed to add some JavaScript to the main page that would add the properties to the IFrame on load. Wix Code doesn't provide any of that kind of functionality.

The extra information would be helpful for potential users, but that shouldn't have been something we were worried about in this first build. The user system was also unnecessary bulk because it just distracted from what our true purpose is supposed to be, though it was pretty cool to work on.

First of all, I wanted to minimize render time caused by jumping from one page to another on a website. As a scroll based website, all components will be rendered in the beginning, then the user is free to view every aspect of the page without having to wait for render time. Another reason I chose my website to be scroll-based is for the modern aesthetic, and the possibility of adding parallax images. Currently, I don\u2019t have any parallax images, but I may add parallax images that fit to the background, which will allow a smoother scrolling interaction feel to the users. "),o.a.createElement("h3",null,"I started off by creating the main pages including Home, About, Projects, Games, Resume, and Contacts. I initially wanted to embed my resume as a pdf file onto my website, but I decided to make it an external link due to the aesthetic challenges of my resume file being black and white. I then added text for each page such as the header to get the basic structure of the webpage. For the Projects and Games page, I implemented a grid tile system to display each project/game as its own clickable element as a pop up. I utilized an overlay component for the pop-up effect, so that users can learn more about my projects/games including what I did, what tools I used, and challenges."),o.a.createElement("h3",null,"For the finishing touches, I experimented with various designs with css.

Usually navbars lay on the top of the webpage, but I wanted my navbar to be very interactive, where it will appear when the user scrolls down, and disappear when the user scrolls up. For this, I utilized react hooks to set different states of the scroll and determine if the user has scrolled up or not. With this, I was able to make a css class that changed its class name when the navbar is hidden or visible. Additionally, I programmed a throttle mechanism for the website to assist in determining the scrolls.")))}}]),a}(n.Component),X=3,K=window.matchMedia("(max-width: 812px)");X=K.matches?2:3;var
