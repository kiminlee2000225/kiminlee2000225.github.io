This made it hard for the players to protect all locations of the tower since when the player was defeating the enemies in time in one position of the tower, the other side of the tower was being damaged. To overcome this issue, a shop mechanic was implemented so that the players may upgrade their weapons, purchase new weapons, and strengthen the walls by increasing their health with gold they collect by defeating enemies.

We believe this is because of the repetitive gameplay without any twist that makes the gameplay unique and fun every time the game is played. We decided to implement ice cream orders, where the word that must be created with the bubbles is given to the player. The orders are words that can be formed with the shootable bubbles and the player must form these words by shooting the necessary bubbles. The orders are very similar to the ones in Overcooked!, where the player must cook the dishes that are given as orders. We decided to make this another game mode, since the difficulty level drops as players are not required to utilize their knowledge of words. This game mode is aimed more towards young players, who may still be in the developing stage, to learn more words. The original mode is aimed towards players who want to challenge themselves by wanting to achieve the highest score. Another challenge we faced is that we ended up having to iterate our game several times during development. We realized this was due to lack of iteration and prototype playtesting. In the future, we will have a clearer goal, with a physical playable prototype to determine if the game idea is well suited for a fun game.

However, even after consideration of the wide characters, TTF_RenderUNICODE_Solid had issues with rendering the stored Japanese characters. I believe the issue was with reading and storing the wide characters and converting the wide characters to a unicode in order to print the unique UNICODE characters. Another consideration I had was downloading and utilizing ttf files that supported such Asian langauges, which I had done. Eventually, I decided to support a langauge with only English alphabet (Roman/Latin alphabet) characters. However, I plan to add functionality to support Japanese (and other Asian lanauges) to the game. Another challenge I faced was with calculating the collision types for the ball. I needed to calculate the collision type, the direction of the collision, and the offset of how much the ball has collided into the paddle, wall, or brick. I utilized a class Vec2 to store vector position variables to calculate the ball collision and offset. There were a lot of visualization required to program collision detections, but the 2D environment made it so that I only had to worry about 2D components.

Instead, we had to embed this code into an IFrame that can't interact with any outside code, which initially should've been fine. However, Chrome now does not allow IFrames to be given access to things like the microphone or audio without that permission being given in the IFrame. Sadly, Wix Code didn't allow usme to interact with the IFrame. To get around this, we needed to add some JavaScript to the main page that would add the properties to the IFrame on load. Wix Code doesn't provide any of that kind of functionality. Instead, we found that behind a paid subscription, we could get it to run custom code on the HTML (originally for data collection purposes).
